This is a basic example on how to link RL4J package with AnyLogic for reinforcement learning experiments.
All the training and simulation components are implemented in Anylogic model file (*.alp).

Anylogic can be downloaded from: https://www.anylogic.com/downloads/.
Please follow the instruction provided in "RL4J Download Instructions.pdf" by Anylogic team to download the RL jar file to be added to the model as dependency.
